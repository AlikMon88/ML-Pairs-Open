Macroeconomic factors—such as interest rates, inflation, GDP growth, unemployment, and central bank policy—serve as the foundational drivers of **systematic risk** in financial markets. This type of risk, inherent to the entire market or market segments, cannot be eliminated through diversification. For instance, a surprise interest rate hike by a central bank can cause a broad decline in equity prices by increasing the discount rate used in asset valuation. In the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), systematic risk is quantified by the beta ($\beta$) of an asset, representing its sensitivity to market-wide movements. Since these macro forces affect most assets simultaneously, they are priced into the market and compensated for with expected returns.

In contrast, **unsystematic risk** arises from firm-specific or industry-specific events—such as poor management decisions, regulatory changes, or product failures—and is considered **diversifiable**. These risks contribute to the idiosyncratic component ($\epsilon$) in the CAPM framework, which can be largely neutralized by holding a diversified portfolio. While systematic risk is unavoidable and earns a risk premium, unsystematic risk does not; rational investors are not compensated for taking on risks they could eliminate through diversification. Understanding the distinction between these two forms of risk is critical in portfolio construction, where the goal is often to retain desired exposure to macroeconomic (systematic) factors while minimizing firm-level (unsystematic) volatility.
